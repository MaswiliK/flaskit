# FlaskIt Philosophy

FlaskIt exists to remove the friction between writing a Flask API and running it in production.

## Core Principles

### 1. Production First

FlaskIt is not a tutorial generator.
Every project it creates should be capable of becoming a real deployed service with minimal changes.

### 2. Opinionated Over Configurable

FlaskIt intentionally chooses defaults instead of offering many options.
Less decision-making means faster development and fewer broken setups.

### 3. One Developer Friendly

FlaskIt is optimized for:

* solo developers
* freelancers
* small teams
* student projects growing into real apps

It is not designed for Kubernetes-scale infrastructure.

### 4. The Same Way Every Time

Projects generated by FlaskIt should look and behave consistently.
A developer should be able to open any FlaskIt project and immediately understand it.

### 5. Local → Production Continuity

Development and deployment should feel like a continuation, not a rewrite.
`flaskit up` and `flaskit deploy` are part of the same workflow.

### 6. Reliability Over Features

We prefer fewer commands that work everywhere over many commands that sometimes fail.

If a feature increases complexity or reduces reliability, it will likely be rejected.

## What FlaskIt is NOT

* Not a replacement for Django
* Not a general-purpose scaffolder for every framework
* Not a DevOps automation platform
* Not a teaching tool

FlaskIt is a fast path to shipping Flask APIs.

## Contribution Guidance

When proposing a feature, ask:

> Does this help a developer go from empty folder to running API faster?

If not, it probably does not belong in FlaskIt.
